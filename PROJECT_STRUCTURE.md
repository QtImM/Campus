# Project Structure

This document describes the organized structure of the Campus project.

## Main Directories

### 📱 `app/`
Main Expo application code with React Native components and screens.

### 🛠️ `services/`
Backend services and API integrations:
- Authentication (Supabase)
- Data services (courses, campus, etc.)
- External API integrations

### 📊 `data/`
All data-related files organized by type:

#### `data/scraped/`
Raw HTML files from web scraping operations:
- Faculty directories from various HKBU departments
- Academic staff listings
- Research staff information

#### `data/parsed/`
CSV files containing parsed data from HTML sources:
- Structured faculty information
- Course data
- Research staff details

#### `data/processed/`
Final processed data ready for application use:
- JSON files for application consumption
- Cleaned and consolidated datasets

#### Root `data/` directory
Database migration files and SQL scripts:
- Schema definitions
- Data migration scripts
- Setup SQL files

### 📜 `scripts/`
Python and JavaScript scripts for data processing:

#### `scripts/scraping/`
Web scraping scripts to extract data from websites.

#### `scripts/parsing/`
Scripts to parse raw HTML data into structured formats.

#### `scripts/consolidation/`
Scripts to merge and consolidate data from multiple sources.

#### Root `scripts/` directory
General utility scripts:
- Database import/export tools
- Data processing utilities
- Evaluation and testing scripts

### 🎨 `components/`
Reusable React Native UI components:
- Campus-specific components
- Common UI elements
- Layout components

### ⚙️ `constants/`
Application constants and configuration:
- Color definitions
- Configuration settings
- Static data

### 🧪 `__tests__/`
Unit and integration tests for the application.

### 📱 `e2e/`
End-to-end test scenarios using Maestro.

### 📚 `docs/`
Project documentation and guides.

### 💡 `ideas/`
Product roadmap and feature ideas.

### ☁️ `backend/`
Backend services and APIs (if any).

### 📦 `supabase/`
Supabase database migrations and configuration.

### 🎨 `assets/`
Static assets like images, fonts, and icons.

### 📱 `android/` & `ios/`
Native platform-specific code (auto-generated by Expo).

## Root Files

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- `app.json` - Expo application configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `babel.config.js` - Babel transpilation settings
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

### Development Files
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - This document
- Various setup and migration scripts

## Data Flow

1. **Scraping**: Raw HTML data is collected in `data/scraped/`
2. **Parsing**: HTML is converted to structured CSV in `data/parsed/`
3. **Consolidation**: Multiple data sources are merged in `scripts/consolidation/`
4. **Processing**: Final data is stored in `data/processed/` as JSON
5. **Application**: Processed data is consumed by the app through services

## Development Workflow

1. Add new scraping scripts to `scripts/scraping/`
2. Add raw HTML output in `data/scraped/`
3. Add parsing scripts in `scripts/parsing/`
4. Keep parsed CSV in `data/parsed/`
5. Use consolidation scripts to merge data
6. Final processed data goes to `data/processed/`
7. Update services to consume new data
